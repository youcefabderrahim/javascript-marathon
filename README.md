# JavaScript Practice Challenges

A full roadmap of practical JavaScript challenges designed to take you from beginner to DOM manipulation mastery. Work through each stage, one challenge at a time. Commit your solutions to your GitHub repository as you complete them.

## üß© STAGE 1 ‚Äì Beginner (Warm-up)

**Goal:** Get comfortable with functions, strings, arrays, and conditionals.

### üí° String & Basic Logic

1. Write a function that takes a name and returns "Hello, <name>!".
2. Write a function that returns whether a word is longer than 5 characters.
3. Write a function that returns the last character of a string.
4. Write a function that counts vowels.
5. Write a function that reverses a string.
6. Write a function that checks if two strings are equal (case-insensitive).
7. Write a function that capitalizes the first letter of a word.
8. Write a function that counts how many times a letter appears in a string.
9. Write a function that replaces all spaces in a sentence with underscores.
10. Write a function that returns whether a given string is a palindrome.

## üßÆ STAGE 2 ‚Äì Arrays & Loops

**Goal:** Learn looping, push/pop, and using array methods.

1. Write a function that returns the sum of all numbers in an array.
2. Write a function that returns the largest number in an array.
3. Write a function that filters only even numbers from an array.
4. Write a function that returns a new array with every element doubled.
5. Write a function that returns how many elements are greater than 10.
6. Write a function that merges two arrays into one.
7. Write a function that removes duplicate elements from an array.
8. Write a function that finds the index of a given element.
9. Write a function that returns the average of an array of numbers.
10. Write a function that reverses an array manually (no `reverse()`).

## üß† STAGE 3 ‚Äì Intermediate (Objects & Logic)

**Goal:** Understand objects, loops, and structured data.

1. Write a function that takes an object and returns all its keys.
2. Write a function that takes an object and returns all its values.
3. Write a function that counts how many properties an object has.
4. Write a function that checks if an object has a certain key.
5. Write a function that returns the sum of all values in an object.
6. Write a function that swaps keys and values in an object.
7. Write a function that takes an array of people (with name and age) and returns only those older than 18.
8. Write a function that finds the person with the highest age.
9. Write a function that groups an array of words by their first letter.
10. Write a function that counts how many times each word appears in a sentence.

## ‚öôÔ∏è STAGE 4 ‚Äì Functions & Logic Practice

**Goal:** Strengthen logical thinking and function skills.

1. Write a function that returns true if a number is prime.
2. Write a function that returns the factorial of a number.
3. Write a function that returns the Fibonacci sequence up to n.
4. Write a function that checks if a number is even or odd.
5. Write a function that takes a temperature in Celsius and returns Fahrenheit.
6. Write a function that returns how many days are left until the end of the year.
7. Write a function that generates a random number between two numbers.
8. Write a function that takes a sentence and returns how many words it has.
9. Write a function that flattens an array of arrays (e.g. [[1,2],[3,4]] ‚Üí [1,2,3,4]).
10. Write a function that returns all unique characters from a string.

## üíª STAGE 5 ‚Äì Small Projects (pre-DOM)

**Goal:** Combine multiple concepts to build mini projects.

1. A simple calculator (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
2. A word analyzer (count letters, vowels, words).
3. A grade calculator (input scores ‚Üí output average + grade).
4. A password strength checker (check for length, numbers, symbols).
5. A random password generator.
6. A guess the number game (random number + user input).
7. A mini library system (add/remove books in an array).
8. A shopping cart (total cost, add/remove items).
9. A todo list (console version) with add, delete, and list.
10. A bank account simulator (deposit, withdraw, balance).

### üß≠ Tip

* Complete one stage at a time.
* Push your progress to GitHub after each solved challenge.
* Use this as a personal training ground before diving into DOM manipulation and projects.
